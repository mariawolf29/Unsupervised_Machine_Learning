# Unsupervised Machine Learning

Presentation of a report of what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how cryptocurrencies could be grouped toward creating a classification for developing this new investment product.

## Goals:

- Prepare the data for dimensions reduction with PCA and clustering using K-means.
- Reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithms from sklearn.
- Predict clusters using cryptocurrencies data using the K-means algorithm form sklearn.
- Create 3D scatter plot using Plotly Express, using hvplot.table create a data table with all the current tradable cryptocurrencies, scatter plot using hvplot.scatter to present the clustered data about cryptocurrencies
